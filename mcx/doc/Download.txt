1. Download the Latest Release

Current Release: [7]MCX and [8]MCXLAB v2020 (1.8 - Furious Fermion), released on Aug. 24, 2020

   Please read the [9]Release notes here.

   Please download MCX and MCXLAB v2020 at our [10]registration/download
   page. We are greatly appreciated if you can tell us a little bit about
   you and your related research by [11]registering your copy of MCX.
   Binary executable (for 32bit and 64bit machines) and source code
   packages are both provided. For MCXLAB, a single package containing the
   pre-compiled Matlab MEX files for 64bit Linux and 64bit Windows is
   provided.

1.1. Test the nightly-build packages

   Starting from Apr. 2016, we automatically compile MCX and MCXLAB on a
   daily basis and upload the binary packages to our [12]nightly-build
   folder. If you want to try out the latest pre-compiled software, please
   browse the following links, and select the package that matches your
   OS:

   for MCX
          [13]http://mcx.space/nightly/mcx/

   for MCXLAB
          [14]http://mcx.space/nightly/mcxlab/

1.2. Get the latest source code

   The latest code can be downloaded from the project's [15]Github
   repository. This can be done using the following git command.

 git clone https://github.com/fangq/mcx.git mcx

   After downloading the source code, please follow [16]the instructions
   to compile and run the software. For windows user, instructions on
   compiling MCX with Visual Studio can be found [17]here.

1.3. Contribute to MCX

   If you are interested in contributing codes, testing data and
   documentation to MCX, please [18]fork this project on github. Once your
   feature is fully developed in your forked branch, please send a
   [19]pull request in order for MCX's developer to review your changes.
