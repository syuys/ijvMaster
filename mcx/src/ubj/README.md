UBJSON C/C++ libraries

This library implements the current draft (draft 12) of the UBJSON specification in ANSI C.

There are three components, each of which may be compiled and used seperately from each-other.

The reader component (ubjr.c) the writer component (ubjw.c) and the transcoder (ubjrw.c).

The API is defined in ubj.h
